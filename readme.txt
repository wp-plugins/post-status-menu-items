This plugin adds all default post statuses to the "Posts" administration submenu.

== Description ==

Adds the following post statuses to the "Posts" administration submenu:

* Drafts
* Pending
* Scheduled
* Published

This is useful for people who regularly use all or most of the post statuses.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the "CMS Post Status Menu" folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
1. Activate the plugin, "Post Status Menu Items" through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Nobody has asked these questions.

= Why aren't there any options? =
Because it provides such minimal functionality, the only "option" is whether the plugin is activated.

= Any plans for updates in the future? =
I might add the post counts at the end of each menu item.

Let me know if that would be useful or if you have other ideas for features.
