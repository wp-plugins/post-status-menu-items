This plugin adds the post statuses—such as "Draft"—to Page, Post, and Custom Post Type admin menus.

== Description ==

This plugin is most useful for people who regularly use all or most of the post statuses. Posts, Pages, and Custom Post Types are all supported by the plugin with options to toggle menu statuses on/off for each post type. _Posts are the only status for which the menu items are enabled by default._

The plugin adds the following post statuses to to the Dashboard's submenus: Drafts, Pending, Scheduled, Published, Private, and Trash. Each post status is followed by the number of posts in that status (e.g. "Drafts (17)"). Statuses with 0 posts are not displayed

== Installation ==

1. Upload the "CMS Post Status Menu" folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
